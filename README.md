# Algorithms
data structure and common algorithms in Java


#### math
* easy
    * Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.
    * permutation
    * combination
 ---

 #### bit
 * easy
    * counting the number of one in an integer formed binary
---


 #### array
 * easy
    * find target in two-dimensional array
    * min number in rotate array

* medium
    * print matrix clockwisely
---


#### linkedlist
* easy
    * reverseList
    * merge two sorted lists
    * determine if a linked list has a cycle in it
    * remove Linked List Elements
    * determine if a singly linked list is a palindrome
    * find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins
    * FindKthToTail
    * duplicate complexed linkedlist

* medium
    * convert a sorted singly linked to a height balanced BST 
    * Split Linked List in Parts 
    * Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List

    * Longest Univalue Path 
    * Binary Tree Paths 
    * Subtree of Another Tree 
    * Path Sum III 
    * Find Mode in Binary Search Tree 
    * judge whether an array is the result of an binary search tree postorders
    * find a path that sum equals a target in a binary tree
    * BST converts to double linked list

* medium
    * Maximum Binary Tree 
    * Insert into a Binary Search Tree
